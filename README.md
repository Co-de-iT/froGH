# froGH
A collection of mixed-purpose user objects for Grasshopper - given "as is" (no warranty, no support) - use at your own risk (but know that we use them too... so they shouldn't explode at least)

### Description
**froGH** is a sparse collection of user objects (some clusters and some C# coded components) born out of necessity or play in our daily Grasshopper experience. You might find them useful (or not). This repo is intended mainly for us, in order to make a more systematic collection, but meanwhile... why not share the code?
Again: **no support is given** so use at your own risk and understanding. If you mess things up using **froGH**, you're on your own.

### Installation
copy the Co-de-iT folder in your User Object folder, new items should appear in the "Extra" tab.

#### Known Bugs
*"wrong" componet display
*If some component displays as diagonal stripes with a triangular icon right click over the icon and select "Internalize" - these components work anyway but at least you will see input and output parameters' names.*

#### Implementations
. Example files
. Better Consistency and graphics
