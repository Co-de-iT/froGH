# froGH
A collection of mixed-purpose user objects for Grasshopper - given "as is" (no warranty, no support) - use at your own risk (but know that we use them too... so they shouldn't explode at least)

Installation: copy the Co-de-iT folder in your User Object folder, new items should appear in the "Extra" tab.
