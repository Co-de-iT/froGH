# froGH
A collection of mixed-purpose user objects for Grasshopper - given "as is" (no warranty, no support) - use at your own risk (but know that we use them too... so they shouldn't explode at least)

Installation: copy the Co-de-iT folder in your User Object folder, new items should appear in the "Extra" tab.

NOTE: if some component display as diagonal stripes with a triangular icon right click over the icon and select "Internalize" - these components work anyway but at least you will see input and output parameters' names.
