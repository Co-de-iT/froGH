# froGH
Ah... that should have been "for GH" but we're so lazy that we misspelt and didn't bother correcting.  
  
**froGH** is a sparse collection of components born out of necessity or play in our daily Grasshopper experience. You might find them useful (or not). If you want to take a peek at the code, head for the **_src_** folder. 

NOTE: _**no warranty or support is given**_ so use it at your own risk and understanding (but know that we use it too... so it shouldn't explode at least). If you mess things up using **froGH**, you're on your own.  
  
On the other hand, if you have any ideas on how to improve things (or you found a bug), please let us know at info[at]co-de-it.com - and feel free to improve upon it yourself, but play nice and give proper attribution (see license).

Some of the code in this plugin was created thanks to the help and support from the amazing people in the Grasshopper community: David Rutten (the man himself), Giulio Piacentino (yeah, that other man), Mateusz Zwierzycki, David Stasiuk, James Ramsden, Fraser Greenroyd, Peter Fotiadis, Ola Jaensson and others - citing in place those whose code we built ours directly upon. If you are one of them and think we did you a disservice, let us know how to attribute properly to you! Other than that.... the rest of the code is by us at Co-de-iT.
