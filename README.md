# froGH
Ah... that should have been "for GH" but we're so lazy that we misspelt and didn't bother correcting.  
Anyway, here's a collection of mixed-purpose components for Grasshopper - given "as is" (no warranty, no support) - use at your own risk (but know that we use them too... so they shouldn't explode at least).

### Description
**froGH** is a sparse collection of components born out of necessity or play in our daily Grasshopper experience. You might find them useful (or not). If you want to take a peek at the code, head for the **_src_** folder. 

NOTE: _**no support is given**_ so use at your own risk and understanding. Example files are on their way, meanwhile... if you mess things up using **froGH**, you're on your own.  
  
On the other hand, if you have any ideas on how to improve things, please let us know at info[at]co-de-it.com - and feel free to improve upon it yourself, but play nice and give proper attribution (see license).

Some of the code is from the amazing people in the Grasshopper community: David Rutten (the man himself), Giulio Piacentino (yeah, that other man), James Ramsden, Mateusz Zwierzycki, and Peter Fotiadis - these people are all named where their code was used in the various components. If you are one of them and think we did you a disservice, let us know how to attribute properly to you! Other than that.... the rest of the code is by us at Co-de-iT.
